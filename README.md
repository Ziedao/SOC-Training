# TryHackMe SOC Level 1 Completion

[Link: TryHackMe SOC Level 1 Path](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/soclevel1)

## Objectives:
- Detect and analyze traffic anomalies
- Monitor endpoints for threats
- Utilize SIEM tools to handle incidents
- Investigate forensic artifacts

## My Experience:
As a cybersecurity student, completing the SOC Level 1 path was a fulfilling challenge that greatly expanded my skill set. The path offers a comprehensive overview of industry-standard tools and processes essential for Security Operations Center (SOC) activities. 

One of the highlights of the path was the in-depth work with SIEM tools like **Splunk** and **Elastic SIEM**, which are critical for monitoring, detecting, and responding to security incidents. I also worked extensively with packet analysis tools like **Wireshark** and **Snort**, gaining valuable insights into real-time traffic monitoring and anomaly detection.


What I found particularly challenging yet rewarding were the forensic analysis tasks. Tools like Autopsy and OSQuery helped me dive into deep artifact investigation, providing a new perspective on system investigations.

The path also introduced me to tools I hadn’t previously encountered, such as Zeek for network monitoring and CyberChef for decoding and analyzing various data formats. These tools expanded my capabilities and understanding of SOC operations.

## Key Skills Learned:
- Utilizing SIEM tools (Splunk, Elastic SIEM) for threat detection and incident handling
- Network traffic analysis with Wireshark, Snort, and Zeek
- Investigating digital forensic artifacts using tools like Autopsy 
- Working with IDS/IPS systems to detect threats
- Automating analysis and threat detection with CyberChef
- Endpoint monitoring and event logging using OSQuery, Event Viewer, and Sysmon

### Highlights:
- **Hands-on practice** with real-world scenarios and security tools I hadn’t worked with before.
- **Incident handling** and response were some of the most practical parts, providing deep insights into analyzing attacks in real time.
- I especially enjoyed using SIEMs to detect anomalies in network traffic and correlating events to piece together attack vectors.

### Challenges:
- **Forensic investigation** required a steep learning curve, especially when diving into detailed network and memory artifacts.
- Managing alerts and distinguishing real threats from false positives within SIEM tools was particularly challenging.
  
Despite the challenges, this experience was incredibly rewarding. It gave me a stronger understanding of the day-to-day tasks of a SOC Analyst and how to apply defensive techniques efficiently.
